Hey there. Hello.
{Joanna}
Hello!
{Matthew}
How's life?
{Joanna}
It's ok!
{Matthew}
Great to hear.
{Joanna}
Did you know you can create pauses in the script?
{Matthew}
No! How!
{Joanna}
Just add an L, M, or S with two dashes.
{Joanna}
Here's a small --s-- pause
{Joanna}
And a medium --m-- pause
{Joanna}
And a longer --l-- pause
{Matthew}
Cool
{Joanna}
You can also use your own <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="pɪˈkɑːn">S S M L</phoneme>tags in the script.
{Matthew}
Fun!
